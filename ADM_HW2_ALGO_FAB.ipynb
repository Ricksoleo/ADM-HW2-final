        "\n",
        "1) Analysis of the Code’s Complexity Using Big O Notation\n",
        "\n",
        "The code consists of a function, solve_cases, which takes two parameters: t (the number of test cases) and test_cases (a list of tuples representing each test case). The purpose of this function is to determine whether, given a number n and a number of elements k, it’s possible to represent n as the sum of k numbers of the same parity (all even or all odd).\n",
        "\n",
        "Analysis of the Main Loop\n",
        "\n",
        "The main loop inside solve_cases iterates over each case in test_cases using a for loop, so the function has a complexity of O(t), where t is the number of test cases. This loop represents the time needed for the function to handle each test case individually, meaning t directly impacts the total complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Analysis of the Loop Body\n",
        "\n",
        "Within the loop, the code checks each test case by applying a few conditions:\n",
        "\n",
        "\t•\tIt verifies whether n is greater than or equal to k and if both have the same parity (using the condition (n % 2 == k % 2)). This modulus and comparison operation has a complexity of O(1).\n",
        "\t•\tAlternatively, it checks if n is at least 2 * k and if it’s even. Again, all operations here, including modulus and multiplication checks, require O(1) complexity.\n",
        "\t•\tFinally, if none of these conditions are met, the code appends the answer “NO” to the results array, which also operates in O(1).\n",
        "\n",
        "Each check only requires a constant number of operations and does not depend on the values of n and k. Even string concatenation operations (like \"1 \" * (k - 1) + str(n - (k - 1))) are based on k but are still executed in constant time for each test case. Therefore, the execution time for each iteration of the loop is O(1).\n",
        "\n",
        "Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "Since all operations within the loop are executed in constant time O(1), and the loop itself repeats t times, the overall time complexity of the code is O(t). This means that the function’s runtime depends linearly on the number of test cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) Time Complexity Evaluation by an LLM (e.g., ChatGPT)\n",
        "\n",
        "A language model (LLM) like ChatGPT should arrive at an assessment consistent with the above analysis, concluding that the code’s overall complexity is O(t). The LLM should recognize that each iteration of the loop is independent and that there are no nested structures or complex operations within the loop that would increase the complexity. My analysis and that of the LLM align, as both recognize that the code has an O(t) complexity, linear with respect to the number of test cases, with no significant dependencies on n or k."
